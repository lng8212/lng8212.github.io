In Android, exceptions are categorized into **checked** and **unchecked exceptions**, just like in Java, since Android is built on the Java platform (or Kotlin, which compiles to Java bytecode). Here's a breakdown:
### 1. **Checked Exceptions

In Kotlin, **checked exceptions** don't exist in the same way as they do in Java. Kotlin doesn’t force you to catch or declare checked exceptions like `IOException`, `SQLException`, etc. This means that Kotlin simplifies exception handling by not requiring you to declare them in the function signature. However, you can still handle exceptions like Java.

**Examples**:

- `IOException`: Thrown when there's an I/O error (e.g., file read/write operations).
- `SQLException`: Thrown when there's an error in database operations.
- `ClassNotFoundException`: Thrown when the JVM cannot find a specified class.

#### **How to Handle Checked Exceptions** in Kotlin:

Even though Kotlin doesn't enforce checked exceptions, you can still handle them using `try-catch`.

**Example**:
```kotlin
fun readFile(filePath: String) {
	try {         
	val file = FileReader(filePath) // May throw IOException         
		val bufferedReader = BufferedReader(file) // File reading logic
	} catch (e: IOException) { // Handle IOException
		e.printStackTrace()     
	} 
}
```

You don’t need to declare `IOException` in the function signature because Kotlin allows unchecked exceptions for most cases, but you must catch them if needed.

### 2. **Unchecked Exceptions in Kotlin**

These exceptions are not checked at compile-time, so you don’t need to declare them or catch them. They usually occur due to bugs, invalid conditions, or programming mistakes (e.g., accessing an invalid index, performing a null operation, etc.).

**Examples**:

- `NullPointerException`: Thrown when accessing or calling a method on a `null` object.
- `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`: Thrown when trying to access an invalid index in an array or list.
- `IllegalArgumentException`: Thrown when a method is passed an illegal argument.
- `ArithmeticException`: Thrown for mathematical errors like division by zero.

#### **How to Handle Unchecked Exceptions** in Kotlin:

Although you don't have to explicitly handle unchecked exceptions, it's best practice to prevent them by validating inputs and conditions before performing operations.

**Example**:
```kotlin
fun divideNumbers(num1: Int, num2: Int) {     
	try {         
		val result = num1 / num2 // May throw ArithmeticException if num2 is 0
		println(result)     
	} catch (e: ArithmeticException) {
	// Handle ArithmeticException (e.g., division by zero)         
	println("Error: Division by zero!")     
	} 
}
```

You can prevent `NullPointerException` by using Kotlin’s **safe calls** (`?.`) and **elvis operator** (`?:`) for null safety:

**Example** (Preventing `NullPointerException`):
```kotlin
fun printLength(str: String?) {     
	println(str?.length ?: "String is null") 
}
```

In this example, if `str` is `null`, it avoids throwing a `NullPointerException` and returns a default value.

### Key Differences in Kotlin:

1. **Checked Exceptions**: In Kotlin, there are no checked exceptions enforced by the compiler, unlike Java. However, you can still use `try-catch` to handle any potential errors like `IOException` or `SQLException` (even if not explicitly declared).
    
2. **Unchecked Exceptions**: These exceptions (e.g., `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException`) are similar to Java’s unchecked exceptions. In Kotlin, you don't have to declare them or handle them unless you want to prevent crashes or provide custom error handling.

### Common Kotlin Example Scenarios:

1. **File I/O (Checked Exception)**: If you're reading from a file, you might encounter an `IOException`. While Kotlin doesn't force you to catch it, you can still do so using a `try-catch` block.
```kotlin
fun readFile(filePath: String) {     
	try {         
		val file = FileReader(filePath)         
		val bufferedReader = BufferedReader(file)// File reading logic     
	} catch (e: IOException) {         
		e.printStackTrace() // Handle the error     
	} 
}
```
2. **Null Pointer (Unchecked Exception)**: Kotlin has built-in null safety features to prevent `NullPointerException`. You can use safe calls (`?.`) or the `!!` operator (to force a `NullPointerException` if the object is `null`).
```kotlin
fun printLength(str: String?) {     
	println(str?.length ?: "String is null") // Safe call with Elvis operator 
}
```
3. **Array Index Out of Bounds (Unchecked Exception)**: Before accessing an array or list, always validate the index.
 ```kotlin
fun accessArrayElement(arr: Array<Int>, index: Int) {     
	if (index in arr.indices) {         
		println(arr[index]) // Valid index access     
	} else {         
		println("Index out of bounds")     
	} 
}
```
### Summary:

- **Checked Exceptions**: In Kotlin, checked exceptions are not enforced (they don’t exist like in Java). However, you can still use `try-catch` blocks to handle them.
- **Unchecked Exceptions**: These exceptions (like `NullPointerException` or `ArithmeticException`) occur at runtime. You don’t have to declare them, but it's good practice to handle them by validating inputs and conditions before performing actions.

By leveraging Kotlin’s features like **null safety** and **safe calls**, you can significantly reduce the chances of encountering unchecked exceptions in your Android code.
